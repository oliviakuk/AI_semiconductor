## ReRAM_Array_Circuit_Design
Welcome to the ReRAM_Array_Circuit_Design repository!

## Overview
This project was developed during my research on Resistive Switching Memory (ReRAM) Arrays.
The focus was on circuit-level design and simulation to explore efficient driving methods and read signal optimization.
You can find the designed code in the repository.

## Features
- Proposed a novel driving scheme for resistive switching memory arrays
- Implemented circuit design with Verilog-A behavioral modeling
- Utilized Silvaco Gateway and SmartSpice for design and simulation
- Designed and optimized ReRAM array read signals
